# HealthVerse-AI — Intelligent Healthcare & Wellness Platform

## Project Overview
HealthVerse-AI is a comprehensive, microservices-based platform designed to integrate healthcare management, AI-driven medical analysis, realtime wellness tracking, and fitness planning into a cohesive ecosystem. 

By leveraging a fully distributed Spring Boot microservices architecture, HealthVerse-AI ensures high scalability, fault tolerance, and secure data segregation. AI is integrated to analyze patient medical reports and provide natural-language insights. Real-time healthcare information is processed securely, maintaining patient confidentiality and strict ownership models.

## Architecture

The system follows a classic API Gateway pattern backed by a Service Registry. The frontend communicates exclusively through the secure Gateway, which routes traffic to the appropriate downstream microservice.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 17** (for local development)
- **Docker Desktop** (with Docker Compose)
- **Maven Wrapper** (included in repository)

## Configuration
The project utilizes environment variables to securely manage secrets and infrastructure endpoints. A `.env.example` is provided in the root directory.

**Crucial Variables**:
- `JWT_SECRET`: Must be a secure string >= 256 bits (e.g., `YourSuperSecureSecretKeyForJWTAuthentication2026!`).
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for PostgreSQL.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Origins permitted by the API Gateway (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- Infrastructure URIs for Mongo and Redis (pre-configured for Docker).

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit the `.env` file containing real production credentials. Always use `.env.example` as a template.

## Docker Documentation
The entire backend ecosystem is fully containerized.

**Build all images:**
```bash
docker compose build
```

**Start the environment (detached mode):**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Check running containers:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

**View logs (for all services or a specific service):**
```bash
docker compose logs -f
docker compose logs -f api-gateway
```

**Stop the environment:**
```bash
docker compose down
```

**Rebuild and Restart:**
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

*Note: Persistent data for PostgreSQL and MongoDB are managed via Docker volumes. If you need to completely reset the databases, use `docker compose down -v` (Destructive action: deletes all persistent data).*

## API Documentation

All API traffic must be routed through the `api-gateway` on port `8080`. Secure endpoints require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user (Body: email, password, name, role).
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive a JWT.

### User & Health Data
- `GET /users/profile` - Retrieve current user's profile.
- `PUT /users/health-profile` - Create/Update user health profile (height, weight, medical conditions).
- `POST /users/daily-data` - Log daily health metrics (steps, sleep, hydration).

### Reports & AI
- `POST /reports/upload` - Upload a medical report (multipart/form-data).
- `GET /reports` - List uploaded reports.
- `POST /ai/analyze` - Request AI analysis of user health data/reports.

### Nutrition, Fitness & Wellness
- `GET /nutrition` - Get personalized nutrition plans.
- `GET /fitness` - Get fitness routines.
- `GET /wellness/summary` - Aggregate wellness score and summary.

## Security Overview
HealthVerse-AI implements a robust, defense-in-depth security model:
- **Stateless JWT**: Authentication relies exclusively on cryptographically signed JWTs, eliminating session-hijacking risks and disabling CSRF entirely.
- **IDOR Protection**: All microservices extract the `userId` directly from the validated JWT claims. Users cannot manipulate IDs in request bodies to access unauthorized data.
- **Strict Gateway Actuator**: The gateway does not expose `/actuator/gateway`.
- **Microservice Actuators**: Internal actuators (`/env`, `/heapdump`) are strictly forbidden (403), allowing only `/health` and `/info`.
- **Secure Headers**: The API Gateway injects strict HTTP security headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`) onto all API responses.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are mathematically hashed via `BCryptPasswordEncoder` prior to PostgreSQL storage.
